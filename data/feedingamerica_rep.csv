I live in Maine with my mom and my brother Zeus. My mom works really hard to make sure me and Zeus have a roof over our head and enough to eat. When we-re eating, she-ll make sure we eat first and are full. Then if there-s leftovers she-ll make dinner for herself. She works from home, but I know it-s still a struggle. During the school year, I get free lunch and breakfast at school, which helps my mom make sure we have enough food for the weekends. But during the summer when school is out, we don-t have those meals, so instead we go to the free lunch program. I love the free lunch program. I go every day. They serve us turkey and cheese, peanut butter and jelly, apples, carrots and broccoli. It-s really good food that gives me the energy I need to be active and play with my friends. It also helps my mom not stress, because she doesn-t have to worry about finding money to feed us extra meals during the summer. Without the lunch program, I would be sad. I-m really happy that we have it. To everyone who makes it possible I want to say thank you. Because you-re making kids like me happy and our parents happy too, by making it easier for all of us to get enough to eat.","My name is Zoey and I-m 11 years old.

Ian specifically helps at the City Market in downtown Kansas City.Ian is a great Harvesters- representative because of his friendly manner and persuasive powers. He always personally speaks with each farmer at the market to politely ask for food donations and explain how difficult it is to access healthy food if you are food insecure.After speaking with Ian, the farmers are always willing to donate. In fact, Ian is so good at this that his girlfriend, who is often with him on these excursions, nicknamed him the _Farmer Charmer”.As a medical student, Ian wholeheartedly believes in and understands the importance of fresh, nutrient-rich produce in everyone-s dietæbut especially for those who are food insecure. He enthusiastically supports Harvesters- goal to provide more produce, and helps Harvesters meet that goal by his efforts.In fact, one memorable Saturday, Ian arrived with more than 1,000 pounds of produce from the market. This was Ian-s first time volunteering and instead of going just to the market stalls of local farmers _ he misunderstood and visited all the commercial stalls too.

Needless to say, this didn't sit well with me. How can kids be hungry in a land as abundant as America? I got to work with my pit crew buddies and we started an organization called Pit Stops for Hope. We immediately teamed up with our local food bank, Second Harvest Food Bank of NW, NC and The Salvation Army of Winston-Salem and we started raising money! Before races on pit road we will sell used lug nuts, used studs, used pit crew gloves and any item we can sell that NASCAR fans will donate for. We've created our own calendars, held multiple fundraisers and do our best to support the organizations that are helping the kids who are battling hunger on a daily basis. We are also working with local schools to help with education and hunger. Pit Stops for Hope believes that education will end hunger. Kids can't learn if they're hungry thus keeping this terrible cycle of hunger roaring out of control. Since we turned in our first check to SHFB back in May 2013, PSFH has donated over $150k to various organizations to combat hunger and excel education in our state.

The things we get are just incredible: fresh, colorful produce, plenty of bread for sandwiches, cereals, milk _ tons of staples. It lets me use our food stamps for meat that I store away in our freezer and it keeps us stocked with healthy foods. Jim even saw his type 2 diabetes disappear. And to make the experience even sweeter, the kids have a ton of fun helping out, setting up tables and boxes of food and helping other families fill up their baskets.Between the mobile pantry, which continues throughout the summer, and a school-sponsored free summer lunch program, we-re getting by even without the daily free lunch we count on during the school year.

As part of her role as a social entrepreneur, Melissa supports and advocates for hunger relief through Feeding America as well as Alameda County Community Food Bank and Food Bank For New York City, both network member food banks that serve the communities where her MJM jewelry boutiques are located. This past holiday season, Melissa Joy Manning hosted in-store events for both network member food banks along with an E-commerce Charity Drive for Feeding America to help raise funds and awareness for hunger relief nationally and in her local communities.Melissa says: _I think there is just so much need, and I see it from my own back door in New York. It pains me to think that I am here doing what I love while knowing at the same time that a kid down the street may miss a meal that day. For me, it-s a matter of sharing our blessings with those who are less fortunate.By giving to Feeding America, I know how much my dollar accomplishes and how many people are impacted by what I am able to give. As a donor, it is empowering to know that I am actively participating in the fight against hunger in my own communities and nationally.I create jewelry to create change. All of our jewelry is made in-house by a team of artists who earn living wages and a competitive benefit and retirement package. We spend most of our lives at work and I believe that work should be a culture that embraces and supports every member.

Because of this I have not been able to work since February 2014 when I lost my job from The Geek Squad at Best Buy which I maintained over two years before the company could no longer accommodate for all the many special circumstances they made for me as a single parent. Caden's special educational placement limits me from doing anything without him outside the hours of 8 am to 2 pm, and that's if I have time to walk home and be here before his bus arrives at 2:15-2:45pm. I have reached out and my own family has done very little for us. I told my own mother a few days ago we had no food and that we had not eaten and she calls my brother. My brother sends me information on three food pantries all very far away and one had a Toyota dealership as its number. Grant we still have had very little to eat since then and this is our support group. We live on SSI for Caden's disability and $127.00 a month food assistance. Caden and I lived in the Greenville Rescue mission a local shelter for seven months until recently a HUD home opened for us. We moved in last month. With our rent and utilities our benefits only went up twenty dollars. We receive 733.00 a month in SSI and 127.00 food. Rent is 450.00' water was almost 80 for the month even though we barely use it and electric 68.

The ability to involve our children is one of the aspects that attracted us to the organization.We support the Los Angeles Food Bank and volunteer there along with our employees at The Agency.

They believe in the value of giving nationally and locally through the Los Angeles Food Bank and have encouraged their children, employees and colleagues to join the fight against hunger.As Jeff says: _For me, hunger-relief is something that my family has been involved with for a long time. I remember that my grandmother used to volunteer at the downtown Sacramento Food Closet _ growing up and seeing homeless and hungry people and hearing her talk about why she volunteered is something that always stuck with me.”Jeff and Kim reflect this sentiment in their own giving and by involving their children and their employees. ""We connected to Feeding America because it allowed us to educate our children on philanthropy and giving back to the community. When we first found out about the organization, it was about supporting initiatives like the BackPack Program, which is something our children can understand and even relate to when you are going to get their school supplies and talking about education. The ability to involve our children is one of the aspects that attracted us to the organization.We support the Los Angeles Food Bank and volunteer there along with our employees at The Agency. They were excited and interested in helping out at the food bank. It-s a reminder that we are so fortunate, and it is also very satisfying to provide our time and help with the cause. Volunteering is something tangible and something you can wrap your arms around. We give nationally to Feeding America because we want to also make a difference on a larger scale. The fact that we can help fight hunger like that via our company is something that-s very exciting for us. That most of our contribution goes to helping others is also a big piece of how we make the decision to support an organization. We know the resources directly support the programs that are important to us and that we believe in.

Last year I became pregnant again. It was a high-risk pregnancy. I was put on bed rest for months, and as a result, lost my job. I cashed in my 401k and sold everything valuable to pay the bills, but even still, I was soon left with nothing. My kids complained there was no food. There has to be something to eat I thought, but there wasn-t. Our food actually ran out. To survive, we started eating cheap foods _ fast foods, ramen, that sort of thing. When my kids- diets changed, their behavior changed. They didn-t sleep and lacked focus. A lady at the hospital introduced me to food stamps. I thought I had really hit a low point _ having to apply. I-m so grateful now though. Food stamps gave me the freedom to purchase healthy foods at the grocery store. I never thought I-d be so excited for my kids eat fruit again. Their behavior went back to normal. I ended up having a beautiful baby boy. Food stamps helped me feed him healthy food too, when I otherwise wouldn-t have been able to. We have a long way to go to get back to our old life, but thanks to food stamps, we-ll all get there _ healthy and strong.","picked a great career for myself _ a nurse.

I work for a company that builds door frames, and he works in fast food. We make enough to pay our bills each month æ gas, electric, mortgage, etc.; but after paying those, there's really not much more to go around. I might have $20, and that's not enough to feed our four kids. I discovered Love, INC, our local food pantry, when I moved into my current neighborhood. A neighbor recommended it, so I thought I'd give it a try. When I went for the first time, I was amazed at how easy it was, and how nice all the volunteers there were.Now, I visit at least once a month, and pick up staples like cereal, yogurt and vegetables for my kids. My kids are growing, and they eat a lot. We can provide some food on our income, but not enough. I'm grateful we have this pantry in our community. It helps us provide the extra food our kids need to grow up strong.","My boyfriend and I both work. I work for a company that builds door frames, and he works in fast food.

At 13, his mother kicked him out of the house and he spent his childhood fending for himself. When Rick got older, he settled into a job at an equipment rental yard. The owner's brother was a recruiter for the army and Rick decided to enlist. He was stationed in California and Panama handling logistics and supply transportation.

""I get a call back: 'your grandmother was killed and your mom and stepfather are in the hospital,'"" said Rick.After helping his parents recover, tragedy struck again. Rick was injured at work and had to have spinal surgery to fuse several vertebrae. After his surgery Rick couldn't find work to support his wife and twin step-children, so he turned to his local veteran's assistance site for help. They provide him with much-needed groceries, and support.Last year, they even provided a special Christmas celebration. ""It was great,"" says Rick. ""My wife was really surprised. We walked out of the [food pantry] with giant baskets of goodies and a Crockpot„we ended up leaving with four or five boxes full of stuff.""

My parents had steady jobs and provided everything I needed. You could say I was spoiled, well, I am, so I never had to experience the pain of not having something to eat. Whenever I threw food away and my parents would say ""do you know how many kids would love that?"" it never affected me because I didn't know how many people would value what I was dumping into the Garbage.Everything changed on day when I was in middle school. I had a friend who, day after day, would either bring the same food over and over or somedays, nothing at all. She told me that she had to provide for her and her younger sisters because her parents weren't around. That's when I finally saw hunger, through the eyes of someone I cared for. I began bringing extra juice boxes and snacks and made sure to slip them to her even when she protested, and I made it my personal mission to make sure she and her sisters were fed. even if it was a little meal. I never wanted payment or accolades or anything for that matter, I just wanted to do something for someone in need. It never occurred to me how much hunger affects people until it either happens to you or someone you care about, but the fact of the matter is, it shouldn't take that much for us to see how much of a problem hunger is.The amount of people that suffer from this epidemic is absolutely astounding and we all hear about it and just seem to turn the other cheek in hopes that it will just, disappear. It wont disappear and it wont change unless we change it ourselves. it all starts with us. One food item at a time.","I've never experienced hunger a day in my life.
